As Floyd Mayweather he is famously known as a world boxing champion, currently undefeated as a professional.</p><p>So how rich is&nbsp;Floyd Mayweather? Sources estimate that his current net worth is $500 million, accumulated during an outstanding boxing career beginning in 1996, however, this amount will rise considerably when his official earnings for his fight in May 2015 against <a href=#>Manny Pacquiao</a> – reputed to be over $100 million for both boxers – is announced.</p><h3>Floyd Mayweather Jr. Net Worth $500 Million</h3><p>Floyd’s childhood was unhappy as his mother used drugs, and he had a somewhat stormy relationship with his father (Floyd Sr.), who was jailed for drug trafficking in 1993. However, he inherited his boxing talent from his father and two uncles who were all boxers too. In his amateur career, Mayweather won three Golden Gloves Championships, in 1993, 1994 and 1996. He was controversially defeated in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games featherweight division final, after which he turned professional.</p><p>During his subsequent professional boxing career to date, Floyd Mayweather has won six world titles at different weights, the first within two years in 1998, the WBC Super Featherweight title against previously undefeated Genaro Hernandez, and the following year The Ring magazine named Mayweather ‘Fighter of the Year’. Floyd Mayweather has also been consistently named the best ‘pound-for-pound’ boxer in the world by authoritative sources. His net worth has grown commensurately with these and subsequent successes, and acknowledgements of his prowess.</p><p>As at April 2015, Floyd Mayweather’s professional record is 47 wins and no loses, so all his fights are impossible to cover, but his most memorable fights, including prize money where known, negotiated beforehand, have been against Diego Corrales (previously undefeated, 2001); <a href=#>Jose Luis Castillo</a> (lightweight title, twice in 2002); <a href=#>Arturo Gatti</a> (2005); <a href=#>Zab Judah</a> (IBF welterweight title, 2006); Carlos Baldomir (WBC welterweight title, $8 million, 2006 ); Oscar de la Hoya (light middleweight title, $25 million, 2007); <a href=#>Ricky Hatton</a> ($25 million, 2007); <a href=#>Shane Mosley</a> ($30 million, 2010); <a href=#>Victor Ortiz</a> (WBC welterweight title, $40 million, 2011); <a href=#>Miguel Cotto</a> ($40 million, 2012); <a href=#>Robert Guerrero</a> ($36 million, 2013); <a href=#>Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez</a> ($41.5 million, 2013); <a href=#>Marcos Maidana</a> (WBA welterweight and WBC super welterweight titles, twice in 2014).</p><p>Clearly, Floyd Mayweather is the highest paid sportsman in the world for single appearances, so there is no suprise that his net worth continues to rise – in fact, Forbes magazine estimates that Floyd’s career earnings amounts to more than $500 million, so one wonders why his current net worth isn’t higher. His contribution to the success of Pay Per View TV is also outstanding, taking part in several of the highest earning events.</p><p>Further, as if to confirm that Floyd Mayweather is indeed light on his feet, he appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” in 2007 with partner professional dancer <a href=#>Karina Smirnoff</a>, finishing in ninth place. Floyd has also appeared in several TV documentaries profiling himself, plus making a few cameo appearances in movie and TV films.</p><p>Regretfully, over the years Floyd also has several convictions against him for domestic violence, including a short jail sentence and orders to perform community service.</p><p>In his personal life, perhaps it’s no surprise that Floyd Mayweather has never been married, as his list of girlfriends is legendary. However, he has two sons and a daughter with <a href=#>Josie Harris</a>, with whom he has had an on-off relationship since school. Floyd also has a daughter with Melissa Brim.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=37.533825338253><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Floyd Mayweather</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 24, 1977</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>150 lbs (68.2657 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Professional Boxer, Athlete, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Ottawa Hills High School, Ottawa Hills High School, Ottawa Hills High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Koraun Mayweather, Iyanna Mayweather, Zion Shamaree Mayweather, Jirah Mayweather</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Parents</td><td>Deborah Sinclair, Floyd Mayweather, Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>Siblings</td><td>Justin Mayweather Jones, Fannie Orr, Deltricia Tawanna Howard, Fatimah Mayweather, Justin Mayweather Jones, Fannie Orr, Deltricia Tawanna Howard, Fatimah Mayweather, Justin Mayweather Jones, Fannie Orr, Deltricia Tawanna Howard, Fatimah Mayweather</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nicknames</td><td>Floyd Mayweather , Floyd Joy Sinclair , Money Mayweathe , Pretty Boy , Floyd Sinclair , Floyd 'Money' Mayweather , Money , Floyd Mayweather Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=0.34042553191489><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/floydmayweather</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/floydmayweather</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/+FloydMayweather</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/floydmayweather</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1459421</a></td></tr><tr readability=14><td>Awards</td><td>Golden Gloves Championships (1993,1994,1996), WBC Super Featherweight title (1998),IBO, IBA Welterweight Champion, WBC, IBF, WBA, WBO Champion, The Ring Champion, Lineal Champion</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Nominations</td><td>Best Boxer ESPY Award, Best Male Athlete ESPY Award, BET Award for Sportsman of the Year, Milliyet Sports Award for World Athlete of the Year, Best Boxer ESPY Award, Best Male Athlete ESPY Award, BET Award for Sportsman of the Year, Milliyet Sports Award for World Athlete of the Year, Best Boxer ESP...</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Dancing with the Stars (2007)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=2><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Refering to himself in the third person tense.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Carrying stacks of US $100 bills</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Undefeated fight record</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=113><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>The American fans would love to see me fight anybody.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>I'll back up anything my dad says.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>I'm not in this sport to take punishment.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>4</td><td>I loved competing and winning and also wanted to continue my career for the fans, knowing they were there for me and enjoyed watching me fight.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>I land a higher percentage of punches than any boxer in boxing.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>6</td><td>You can never overlook a guy.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>7</td><td>I like to play table tennis, spend time with my kids.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>8</td><td>I've set the model of showing fighters how they should conduct their business.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>9</td><td>Floyd Mayweather is in the sport to give great performances.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>I got a big mouth.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>11</td><td>I ain't never nervous.
