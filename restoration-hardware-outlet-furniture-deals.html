The retailer—which recently shortened its name to RH—has earned a reputation as one of the best resources for anything from sophisticated sofas to chic chandeliers and everything in between. Many also know that the store's refined-looking items tend to carry a hefty price tag. However, if you're looking to remodel on a more modest budget, you can take advantage of the furniture deals available at the Restoration Hardware Outlet. Read on to see how to score discounts of up to 90 percent off.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Sam's Club Sells a Cheap Anthropologie Cabinet Dupe—Is It Just as Good?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/restoration-hardware-rh-store-mall-outlet-furniture-deals.jpg><p>Getting any kind of savings on furniture can be a serious game changer when you're looking to update your home. But if you've counted out higher-end stores like Restoration Hardware, think again: You can likely score some fantastic deals if you're willing to visit an RH outlet location.</p><p>Don't feel too bad if you're unfamiliar with the retailer's discount stores. The company's website does not mention how many locations it operates or where they're even located. But the lesser-known shopping secret is beginning to spread thanks to social media.</p><p>In a video posted in Feb. 2022, TikTok user @feelathom peruses offerings at an RH Outlet in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Vero Beach, Florida</a>. A quick scan of price tags reveals several deals, including a teak armchair discounted from $1,400 to $867, a large desk cut down from $2,530 to $1,640, and a dining table reduced from $4,700 to $2,820—all in seemingly top condition.</p><p>Another video posted in July by @letthemeatthis tours the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Chandler, Arizona, location</a> of the retailer's outlet. They say the condition of the furniture was "almost brand new for most of the items," adding they found everything from "duvet covers, furniture, [and] pillows," as well as housewares and art. They also explain that discounts start at 50 percent—and go all the way up to 90 percent off.</p><p>The stores have even attracted some celebrity clientele. In a video posted in June, Real Housewives of New York City alum and entrepreneur <strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong> claims <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>she knows the outlet</a> so well that she "could work here." She then follows an employee named Marion, proving her knowledge—even admitting she tried to help a customer during her walk-around—highlighting some of the store's best deals, including the Maxwell model sofa she had in a previous apartment.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>7 Secrets You Need to Know Before Shopping at Outlet Stores, According to Experts</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/restoration-hardware-rh-store-interior-showroom-furniture-deals.jpg><p>As is implied, the existence of any outlet makes it easy to score a great deal on items you're looking to pick up. And while it comes down to where you live, it might be worth making the trek to take advantage of the savings—especially since they're spread across 21 states, <strong>Julie Ramhold</strong>, a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>consumer analyst</a> with DealNews.com, tells Best Life.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Just keep in mind that the selection and prices will vary based on location, as will the quality of the goods. "As the merchandise at these stores can include items that were returned as well as those with manufacturing defects, there's a chance that they'll have damage to some degree," she warns. "That damage could be extremely obvious or more slight cosmetic imperfections. However, merchandise can also include items that were simply overproduced, so don't let the fear of damaged goods scare you away from checking these stores out."</p><p>She notes that at most outlets, items that hang around long enough will see deeper discounts as time passes—potentially being discounted further each week. "Some shoppers have reported items reaching discounts as high as 90 to 95 percent off, so if you're near a Restoration Hardware outlet store, it's worth checking on products every few days to see if prices have dropped further," she suggests.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>7 Home Stores That Sell the Best Quality Couches</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/couple-moving-armchair-restoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.jpg><p>Unlike some companies that produce lines specifically for their discount locations, items at RH outlets are the exact same products you'd find in regular Restoration Hardware stores. This means you can still expect high-grade quality—even if it's been damaged in transit—so you won't have to worry about quality being lesser just because it comes at a smaller cost, Ramhold says.</p><p>However, beware that not everything in an outlet store will drop all the way to a rock-bottom price. "It seems that items that were produced in excess may see markdowns to outlet prices but may not see further discounts," she cautions. "For example, an item that regularly goes for $2,500 in a standard Restoration Hardware store may only see a discount to $1,500 or so at an outlet store. That doesn't mean it's a bad deal, but it's good to temper your expectations ahead of time so that you aren't holding off on something you love, hoping for a better price that will never come."</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Crate & Barrel Outlet Sells Furniture for 65% Off—Are the Deals Worth It?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/woman-furniture-shopping-restoration-hardware-outlet.jpg><p>While you can count on finding deals at any Restoration Hardware Outlet, it's important to remember that it's not just the prices that are different. Ramhold suggests keeping a few things in mind before you decide to take anything home.</p><p>"Like other outlet stores, it's best to assume all sales are final at RH Outlet, but definitely ask when shopping to be sure," she suggests. "It's also worth reading up on how other shoppers have negotiated even better discounts at RH Outlet stores so you can try your hand at snagging a lower price. Keep in mind your experience may vary, so don't count on getting the lower price, but it can't hurt to try—just be sure to be polite when haggling to increase the odds, though."</p><p>She also points out that some shoppers report RH Outlet stores can't hold or ship items, which means anyone making a serious trek to visit one should be prepared to lug anything major home on the spot.</p><p>"Additionally, if you see something with a clearance tag and you're curious about future markdowns, take a picture of the tag so you'll know a rough schedule of when the next one is coming," she says. "That said, waiting can always mean you end up missing out entirely, so be cautious with this strategy."</p><p><strong>For more shopping advice delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq52jqbyzrdOipqdlmJa%2FpcPAq5xmp6WpuabAjJ%2Bsq6aZqcKzsYydnJqko2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html&text=Inside%20Restoration%20Hardware%20Outlet%20Furniture%20Deals%20%20Best%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html&title=Inside%20Restoration%20Hardware%20Outlet%20Furniture%20Deals%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html&title=Inside%20Restoration%20Hardware%20Outlet%20Furniture%20Deals%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html&title=Inside%20Restoration%20Hardware%20Outlet%20Furniture%20Deals%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frestoration-hardware-outlet-furniture-deals.html&description=Inside%20Restoration%20Hardware%20Outlet%20Furniture%20Deals%20%20Best%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brandy-mccaslin-killed-her-3-children-billy-noe-bryce-and-later-killed-herself-at-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brandy McCaslin killed her 3 children Billy, Noe, Bryce, and later killedherselfathome">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suzanne-malveaux-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suzanne Malveaux Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
